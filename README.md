# Bow Box - Expressive Violin Synthesizer

*This project was made for the 2023 Synthmas Contest. No code was used from any other projects.*

Inspired by the Flatbox design. The Bow Box is a simple synthesizer, capable of playing 6 voices at the same time. The algorithm was custom made. It uses tuned waveguides and modal synthesis to create the desired sound. It needs minimal parts and has a simple schematic. The enclosure is easily 3d printable and customizable. 

# The Repo is divded in to various sections
- CAD = 3d prining + schematic
- Notes = Jupyter Notebook
- Code = Cpp Files
